# Celestial-Map-Umbrella

Astronomy project that accurately depicted the celestial map on the inside of an umbrella. Every distance between the stars and constellations on the umbrella is up to scale. Also every star is coloured with its real colour which can be determined by its temperature. It was a solo project and it was recognised by an award of excellence from the Astonomy and Space Society of Volos.
